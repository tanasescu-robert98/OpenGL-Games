As it is stated in the Error message you have to "fetch first." This worked for me. Use the command:

git fetch origin master
Then follow these steps to merge:

git pull origin master
git add .
git commit -m 'your commit message'
git push origin master

How to update from local to online?

git add .
git commit -m "my changes" 
git remote add origin https://github.com/zinmyoswe/React-and-Django-Ecommerce.git
git push -u origin master
